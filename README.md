# Medical-Image-Triage-and-Classification-System-Based-on-COVID-19-CT-and-X-ray-Scan-Dataset

Here shows the code and the dataset from the paper Medical Image Triage and Classification System——Based on COVID-19 CT and X ray Scan Dataset

## Dataset

You can download the dataset and weight from the folder.

## Requirement

Before you run the code, you must confirm that your python environment has such packages:

skimage;

os;

sklearn;

seaborn;

matplotlib;

keras;

numpy;

scrpy;

time;

torch;

IPython;



## Run the code

If you want to test the step of first OOD, you can run the code under the folder which is called 'first_OOD', the name of the python code is 'first_OOD.py'.
If you want to test the step of our integrated criticism system， you can run the code name 'main.py' which is under the folder called 'second_OOD'. The results from both the GLCM_SVM and our VMDD will be shown when you run the code.
If you want to test the classification model, you can run the code, you can run the code name 'DenseNet169.py' which is under the folder called 'classification_model'.
If you want to test the whole progress, you can run main.py in the home page.
